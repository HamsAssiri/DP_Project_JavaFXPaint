# Software Design Patterns Project !
This project demonstrates the application of various design patterns such as Creational, Structural, and Behavioral within a JavaFX Paint application. 
The original project is a simple drawing program built with JavaFX, inspired by this repository:[https://github.com/ahmedhammad97/Javafx-Paint-Application]

The goal of this project is to showcase how design patterns can improve the structure, flexibility, and maintainability of a graphical application.
By integrating these patterns, we aim to make the code more organized and easier to extend or modify in the future.
